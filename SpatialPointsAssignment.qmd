This homework is a bit quick but is designed to make sure that:

1.  To make sure everyone can get their computer up-to-date with the proper set of libraries so that we can work with geospatial data, and
2.  Give you some practice turning normal numerical data into geospatial coordinates and performing basic operations.

## Spatial Libraries

The following code defines the set of necessary libraries for the next few weeks and then figures out which (potential) subset you need to install. It then installs them all in one call. It will not load them into your session, you'll have to do that later in your code chunks.

***(Hidden: Took up a lot of space)***

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
needed_libraries <- c("sf",
                      "maps",
                      "units",
                      "GGally",
                      "raster",
                      "mapproj",
                      "leaflet",
                      "rnaturalearth",
                      "rnaturalearthdata"
                      )
# Determines which libraries you do not have
#   already installed.
need_inst <- setdiff( needed_libraries, 
                      rownames( installed.packages()) )
# Install the necessary ones.
if( length( need_inst ) ) {
  install.packages( need_inst, dependencies = TRUE )
}

library (tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(sf)
library(maps)
library(units)
library(GGally)
library(raster)
library(mapproj)
library(leaflet)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(rnaturalearthdata)
```

## The Data - Preprocessing

The data for this is some site-level data from the Sonoran Desert bark beetle. The URL is in the next chunk, and is currently being hosted on my class [Github repository](https://github.com/dyerlab/ENVS-Lectures). Load it in.

```{r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyerlab/ENVS-Lectures/master/data/Araptus_Disperal_Bias.csv"


bug <- read_csv( url )

```

### Interactive Map

Use the `leaflet` library and make an interactive map. If you can, add a label to each marker with the ID of the site. You can look at the provider tiles [here](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/) and use on in the `addProviderTiles()` function.

There is a great tutorial [here](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/map_widget.html) on how to customize the leaflet display. You may want to go look at it and see what you can use to make a better display.

```{r}
bug <- bug %>%
  mutate(Site = as.factor(Site))

# Create the leaflet map
leaflet(bug) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(
    ~Longitude, ~Latitude,
    label = ~paste0("Site: ", Site),
    popup = ~paste0("Site: ", Site, "<br>",
                   "Latitude: ", Latitude, "<br>",
                   "Longitude: ", Longitude)
  )
```

### Converting to `sf` Objects

Convert the spatial data in the beetle data.frame into an `sf` object. Make sure you set the Coordinate Reference System to $4326$.

```{r}
# convert raw data to simple features in your data.frame

bug_sf <- st_as_sf(bug, coords = c("Longitude", "Latitude"), crs = 4326)

```

### Questions

For these questions, you may want to look at the `sf` cheat sheet [here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/main/sf.pdf) to find the appropriate geospatial function.

How far apart (in km) are the sites ConstituciÃ³n (`const`) and San Francisquito (`sfran`)?

```{r}
# Calculate the distance between the two sites
distance <- st_distance(bug_sf[bug_sf$Site == "const", ], bug_sf[bug_sf$Site == "sfran", ])

# Convert the distance from meters to kilometers
distance_km <- distance / 1000

# Print the distance in kilometers
print(distance_km)

```

***Answer: 290.09 km***

Is there a correlation between habitat suitability and the ratio of males to female beetles sampled at each locale?

```{r}
ggplot(bug, aes(x = Suitability, y = MFRatio)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Relationship between Suitability and Male/Female Ratio: Araptus attenuatus",
       x = "Suitability",
       y = "M/F Ratio")

# Calculate the correlation coefficient
correlation <- cor(bug$Suitability, bug$MFRatio)

# Print the correlation coefficient
print(paste("Correlation coefficient:", correlation))
```

***Answer: This value indicates a weak negative correlation between habitat suitability and the ratio of male to female beetles sampled at each locale. The data suggests that there's a slight tendency for areas with higher habitat suitability to have a lower proportion of male beetles, but this relationship is not very strong. Other factors might also be influencing the male-to-female ratio, or there might be more complex relationships at play.***

Make a plot using `ggplot` of the data with suitability as the size of the points and the sex ratio as the fill color.

```{r}
# Create a new column "SexDominance" based on MFRatio
bug <- bug %>%
  mutate(SexDominance = case_when(
    MFRatio > 1 ~ "Male-dominated",
    MFRatio < 1 ~ "Female-dominated",
    TRUE ~ "Balanced"
  ))

# Create a scatter plot with point size representing suitability and fill color representing sex dominance
ggplot(bug, aes(x = Males, y = Females, size = Suitability, color = SexDominance)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Male-dominated" = "navyblue", "Female-dominated" = "darkred", "Balanced" = "grey")) +
  labs(title = "Relationship between Males, Females, Suitability, and Sex Dominance",
       x = "Males",
       y = "Females")
```

Reproject the data and plot it again using an EPSG code defined for Mexico UTM zone 12N (see [epgs.io](https://epsg.io) for projections).

```{r}
bug_sf <- st_as_sf(bug, coords = c("Longitude", "Latitude"), crs = 4326)

# Use EPSG code for Mexico UTM zone 12N (EPSG:32612)
utm_crs <- 32612

# Reproject the sf object to the UTM zone
bug_sf_utm <- st_transform(bug_sf, crs = utm_crs)

# Create the scatter plot with reprojected data (using bug_sf_utm)
ggplot(bug_sf_utm, aes(x = st_coordinates(bug_sf_utm)[,1], y = st_coordinates(bug_sf_utm)[,2], size = Suitability, color = SexDominance)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Male-dominated" = "navyblue", "Female-dominated" = "darkred", "Balanced" = "grey"), na.value = "grey") +
  labs(title = "Relationship between Males, Females, Suitability, and Sex Dominance (UTM zone 12N)",
       x = "Easting (meters)",
       y = "Northing (meters)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 10)
  )
```
