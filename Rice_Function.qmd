## Function

I have this as an R-Script in my files but I did not know how to turn that into an html file to upload a link so I copied and pasted my code into this quarto document for proof of work.

```{r}
# A function to get data from the example Rice Rivers Center used in class

# This data is in the imperial system, has "DateTime" a time object, has new columns for month/day/weekday,
# has only necessary data (more may be removed if determined unnecessary), and has been annotated to follow the steps I took. 

get_rice_data <- function() { 
  
# Calling in Packages
library (tidyverse)
library(lubridate)


# Reading in Files
url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mk1YGH9LqjF7drJE-td1G_JkdADOU0eMlrP01WFBT8s/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv"
rice <- read_csv( url )

# Convert to character
rice$DateTime <- as.character(rice$DateTime)

# Trim white space
rice$DateTime <- trimws(rice$DateTime)

# Convert using as.POSIXct with the appropriate format
rice <- rice %>%
  mutate(
    DateTime = as.POSIXct(DateTime, format = "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p"),  # Specify the format
    Month = factor(month(DateTime, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE), levels = month.abb),
    Day = day(DateTime),
    Weekday = factor(wday(DateTime, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE), levels = wday(1:7, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE))
  )

#Finding NA Values
sum(is.na(rice$DateTime))

#Looking at them
na_entries <- rice %>%
  filter(is.na(DateTime))

print(na_entries)

#Filtering them out 
rice <- rice %>%
  filter(!is.na(DateTime))

# Convert H2O_TempC to Fahrenheit and rename, convert Depth_m and SurfaceWaterElev_m_levelNad83 to feet, and rename columns
rice <- rice %>%
  mutate(
    H2O_TempF = (H2O_TempC * 9/5) + 32, 
    SurfaceWaterElev_ft = SurfaceWaterElev_m_levelNad83m * 3.28084  # Convert to feet
  )
 
#Making new dataset without unnecessary columns
rice_cleaned <- rice %>% 
  select(
    DateTime,
    Month,
    Day, 
    Weekday,
    RecordID,
    PAR,
    WindSpeed_mph,
    WindDir,
    AirTempF,
    RelHumidity,
    BP_HG,
    Rain_in,
    H2O_TempF,
    SpCond_mScm,
    Salinity_ppt,
    PH,
    Turbidity_ntu,
    Chla_ugl,
    BGAPC_CML,
    BGAPC_rfu,

    ODO_mgl,
    Depth_ft,
    SurfaceWaterElev_ft
  )

}
