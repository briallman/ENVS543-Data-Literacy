## Interest 1: Data Visualization

My biggest passion and career goal lies in bridging the gap between scientific research and public understanding, fostering informed engagement with critical issues through interactive maps, infographics, and data visualization.

I have done this in a few pretty cool ways...

## ArcGIS Pro & ArcGIS Online

Recently, I was able to make a Data Hub and StoryMap for USFWS and The Golden Winged Working Group!

## Interest 2: Habitat Restoration

Some other interests I have in Environmental Studies is Habitat Restoration, specifically through invasive species removal. Yes, Dr. Crawford's class did spark this passion. While most of the volunteering I have done with JRPS has involved manual removal, it was worth well worth the hard labor!

## Interest 3: Continuous Monitoring

Another passion is continuous monitoring. At the VaDEQ I do continuous monitoring for a temperature TMDL study. I can't post any pictures of my maps as they are still in the works/not publicly available yet (and this repository is public)...but I really do enjoy going out into the field and then learning how to work with the data in the off-season!

## Interest 4: Being Outside!!!

Why would I be an environmental studies major if I didn't truly love the environment and being immersed in it. Kayaking, fishing, hiking, biking, and sightseeing are some of the things that bring me the most joy in life!!!
